**Phillips OS** is a browser-based desktop environment built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates the interface of an operating system, with interactive elements like windows, taskbars, and app icons â€” all rendered in the browser.

This project is part of my ongoing effort to sharpen my front-end development skills by designing and building a full user interface experience from the ground up.

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

This project is a hands-on learning experience where Iâ€™m applying:

* **HTML** for structure
* **CSS** for layout, styling, and animation
* **JavaScript** for dynamic interaction and behavior

Rather than following tutorials, I'm building Phillips OS from the ground up to better understand how each layer of a web application comes together.
